# Setup

- Clone repository by executing the command `git clone https://github.com/northlake-bible-church/nbc-html.git && cd nbc-html` could also need to switch to `cd northlake-bible-church/nbc-html`
- Install the dependencies by running `npm i`
- Run the command `gulp default` to launch the site in a browser.  This also inits the task runner that listens for changes to the source files then compiles, and refreshes the browser.
